                        //3. Deque :- Double Ended Queue

// * Deque :- means double ended queue works totally same as list
// * Dequeue :- method to pop an element from a queue
// * All methods from list works here also
// * List is internally a doubly linked list :- Random Access is not possible.
// * Deque is internally implemented with help of dynamic Array :- so Random Access is possible here
